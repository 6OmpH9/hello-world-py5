# hello-world, this is my GitHub.
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress as a creative coder. This repository is where I will keep sketches that I create in py5.

The goal is to take inspiration from various tutorials and resources I find and convert them into python code, specifically py5 which is a python version of Processing. 

The process of learning and understanding the concepts of creative coding and converting them to python whilst maintaining an active repository on GitHub will be a valuable learning experience.

Ultimately the goal is to have fun with the learning experience and expand into a new creative outlet.
